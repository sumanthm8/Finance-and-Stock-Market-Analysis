Stock market analysis using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is a way to predict stock prices or market trends by looking at past data. The model is trained on things like historical prices, trading volumes, and other market indicators, helping it recognize patterns that might indicate where the market is headed next.

ANNs work by simulating how our brains process information, with layers of "neurons" that learn from the data over time. As the network trains, it adjusts itself to make better predictions, ultimately providing insights into when to buy or sell stocks.

What makes ANNs really useful is their ability to identify complex patterns that traditional methods might overlook. This gives investors a better chance to navigate the ups and downs of the market and make more informed decisions.
